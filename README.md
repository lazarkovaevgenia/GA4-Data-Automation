# GA4-Data-Automation

This repository contains a Python script for automating the download of data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) using the Google Analytics Data API (v1beta). The script initializes with credentials from a service account, constructs and sends requests to fetch specified metrics and dimensions, and processes the returned data into a pandas DataFrame. It is designed to facilitate easy extraction of user and session metrics across different devices, outputting the results directly into an Excel file for further analysis.
